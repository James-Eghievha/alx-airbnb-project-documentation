# User Stories - Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
This directory contains user stories that translate the technical use case diagram into human-centered narratives. These stories capture the real motivations, needs, and goals of people who would use our Airbnb clone platform.

## Purpose
User stories serve to:
- Bridge the gap between technical requirements and human needs
- Provide development teams with context about user motivations
- Guide feature prioritization based on user value
- Inform UI/UX design decisions
- Create acceptance criteria for testing and validation

## Story Format
Each user story follows the standard format:
```
As a [type of user],
I want [goal/functionality],
So that [benefit/reason].
```

## User Personas Considered
Our user stories are based on realistic personas in the Nigerian context:
- **Business Travelers** - Professionals visiting Nigerian cities for work
- **Family Vacationers** - Families seeking comfortable accommodations for leisure trips
- **Property Owners** - Individuals monetizing their real estate investments
- **Platform Administrators** - Staff ensuring platform quality and safety

## Geographic Context
